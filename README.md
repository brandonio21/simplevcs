simpleVCS
=========
simpleVCS is a single-developer version control system that is meant to be
simple. Here are a few things that simpleVCS can do:



`svcs setup` creates an information file about your project.  
`svcs watch` tells svcs which files are going to be changed.  
`svcs add` adds the new version of watched files to a staging area (like git).
`svcs submit` submits the new version of watched files to its versioning history.  
`svcs list` lists all previous submissions  
`svcs compact` compacts all svcs data so that it can be shared.  
`svcs revert` changes files to the state they were in in previous submissions.
